    <h1>Beef Bourguignon (Advanced Weekend Version)</h1>
    <p>Yield: 6 servings. Time: 3½–4½ hours (mostly unattended).</p>
    <p>Ingredients: beef chuck 1.5 kg (cut into 5 cm cubes), bacon 150 g (lardons), carrot 3 (large, chunked), yellow
        onion 2 (large, diced), cremini mushrooms 400 g (halved), garlic 6 cloves (smashed), tomato paste 2 tbsp,
        all-purpose flour 3 tbsp, dry red Burgundy 750 ml (1 bottle), beef stock 500 ml, brandy 60 ml, thyme 6 sprigs,
        bay leaves 2, parsley stems 6, black pepper 1 tsp (freshly ground), salt 2½ tsp (divided), butter 2 tbsp, olive
        oil 2 tbsp, pearl onions 250 g (peeled, optional), lemon zest 1 strip, Worcestershire 1 tsp.</p>
    <p>Steps: 1) Pat beef dry; season with 1½ tsp salt and pepper. 2) In a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat, cook bacon
        until crisp; remove bacon, keep fat in pot. 3) Working in batches, brown beef on all sides (8–10 min per batch);
        transfer to a tray. 4) Add 1 tbsp oil if needed; sauté carrots and diced onions with a pinch of salt until
        lightly browned (6–8 min). 5) Stir in garlic for 30 sec, then tomato paste; cook until brick red (1–2 min). 6)
        Sprinkle flour; stir 1 min to coat. 7) Deglaze with brandy (off heat if using gas); scrape fond. 8) Add wine;
        simmer 3 min. Return beef and bacon; add stock to just cover. 9) Bundle thyme, bay, parsley stems, and lemon
        zest in kitchen twine; add to pot with Worcestershire. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and braise at low simmer
        or 160 °C / 325 °F oven for 2–2½ hours, until beef is fork-tender. 10) Meanwhile, in a skillet, sauté mushrooms
        in butter and remaining oil over medium-high until deeply browned; season with a pinch of salt. If using pearl
        onions, brown them briefly in the same pan. 11) When beef is tender, remove herb bundle. If sauce is thin,
        simmer uncovered 10–20 min to reduce to a glossy gravy that coats a spoon. 12) Stir in mushrooms (and pearl
        onions) and adjust seasoning with remaining salt and more pepper; rest 10 min.</p>
    <p>Notes: Serve with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes and chopped parsley. For shine and body, whisk in 1 tbsp
        cold butter off heat. Make-ahead improves flavor; chill overnight and reheat gently. For gluten-free, swap flour
        for 1½ tbsp cornstarch slurry added near the end. Use good but not pricey wine you’d drink—Burgundy is classic;
        a sturdy Pinot Noir or Côtes du Rhône also works.</p>
